				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>
					People are always curious to try that new spot in town. Most often than not, they end up going there by themselves. Schedules are hard to synchronize.
					And even if by some miracle you could go out with your group of friends, it is not mandatory for everyone to enjoy that cool place you found online.
				</p>

				<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p>
					This is where <em>Clique</em> comes in! Clique is an app that matches its users based on common places of interest. Found that new hot spot in town?
					Choose the desired timeframe and you will be matched with people wanting to go there as well. Once two people like each other, they are automatically
					put in the same group. After you all had a good time, if you enjoyed a person in particular, add them to your clique and go out again!

				<h2>Customer Segment</h2>
				<p>
					Clique is designed with young adults in mind. Those who are already comfortable meeting new people online on social media platforms
					will find themselves right at home. People who might otherwise find it hard to connect on the spot can use the platform to make new,
					meaningful relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					In more precise terms, this means generally a customer group of people from 19 to 35 years old, with access to an internet-connected
					smartphone, mainly located in an urban area.
				</p>

				<h2>Competition</h2>
				<ul>
					<h3><a href="https://okplusone.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">PlusOne Social</a></h3>
					<p>
						As the name suggests, it allows finding a "plus one" so as not go out alone. It is limited only to one-on-one 
						interactions and users have to post a public invite in order to find a partner.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.skout.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Skout</a></h3>
					<p>
						Skout is a subscription-based service that allows its users to make new friends but does not focus specifically
						on partnering up to go out.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.meetme.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">MeetMe</a></h3>
					<p>
						MeetMe builds up a user profile and lets people connect through public posts. 
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://bumble.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Bumble BFFs</a></h3>
					<p>
						Through Bumble, people can choose to interact with other users they matched with in the last 24 hours. It can also be
						used to search for friendships instead of romantic interests.
					</p>
				</ul>

				<h2>What We Bring to the Table</h2>
				<p>
					Clique is focused on creating <em>groups of people</em>. It uses a matchmaking system based on mutual swipes to ensure that two
					people agree with each other. It also aims to build relationships that extend over a simple night out. Users can add people to their
					own personal <em>clique</em> to go out again. And one person can be part of multiple cliques! One for every place they fancy going out to.
				</p>

				<h2>Key Metrics</h2>
				<p>
					Our service measures its success based on the following quantifiable indicators:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Number of new users per month;
						</li>
						<li>
							Active monthly users;
						</li>
						<li>
							Number of successfully created groups;
						</li>
						<li>
							Number of monthly active cliques.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Cost Structure</h2>
				<p>
					There is a combination of both variable and fixed costs as far as the cost structure of Clique is concerned:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Variable costs:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Cloud Hosting Services;
								</li>
								<li>
									Google Maps API.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed costs:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Marketing and Advertising;
								</li>
								<li>
									Website Custom Domain and Email Server;
								</li>
								<li>
									Licensing Fees.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
				<p>
					Clique can support multiple revenue streams. 
				</p>

				<p> 
					On one hand, it will serve relevant advertisements to its users in a non-intrusive way. Users can also opt for a monthly subscription fee
					to stop receiving sponsored content and to gain early access to new features <br>
					On the other hand, venues can pay for a place at the top of our local hotspots list.
				</p>

				<p id="Milestone_2" title="Milestone 2"><em>Milestone 2</em></p>

				<h2>Identifying the Problem</h2>

				<p>
					The idea for the project came naturally from our group of friends. When planning a night out, the process usually involved lots of back-and-forth
					texting between us. Trying to find a time where most of us could make it proved to take us more time than actually figuring out where to go.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another issue was when our group of friends did not have enough people to accommodate a certain activity. The most recent event was when trying to
					plan out a paintball game and figuring out that five people would not make for much of a fun game. That is when we had to go out of our way to find four
					more people who enjoyed getting a fresh coat of paint along with some small bruises to document the fun times.
				</p>

				<h2>Initial Solution</h2>

				<p>
					We started looking at the problem from an individual's point of view: trying to connect with people based on similar interests and form a new group of friends.
					This would have allowed for flexibility, meaning you could have chosen one of your many, newly formed groups of friends for each one of your planned activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					A user would express the desire to go to a certain place and receive suggestions of people wanting to go there as well. Initially, if two people wanted to be part of the
					same group, a new party would be formed and new members would have needed to be accepted by the group as a whole.
				</p>

				<h2>Planning out Customer Discovery</h2>

				<p>
					We set off firstly drawing out the necessary attributes that our average user had to have: 
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							be familiar with technology;
						</li>
						<li>
							live in a place with enough social offers to make going out attractive;
						</li>
						<li>
							be open to meeting new people with similar interests as them.
						</li>
					</ul>

					Then we came up with an age group (18 - 30 years old) which we then divided into smaller groups based on current educational and employment status. This is how we ended up with three main groups:
					18 - 23, 24 - 27 and 28 - 30 years old.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step was creating a rough persona for every segment, identifying main interests, life defining events (Bachelor's degree, getting the first job) and overall social status. This led us to a
					a more targeted approach in terms of how we carried out the validation process.
				</p>

				<h2>The Discovery Process</h2>

				<h3>Identifying the Segments</h3>
				<p >
					We decided from the start to only focus on people over 18, due to the fact that they have a more active social life and can also provide consent as far as meeting new people is concerned. Afterwards, a major
					differentiator between the segments was the last graduated form of education.
				</p>

							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										Another decision we made from the start was to focus on the urban environment because of all the opportunities it provides in terms
										of activities for people to enjoy. After roughly figuring out the segments, we began describing them in more detail, referring to their income and 
										whether or not they had a strongly linked group of friends.

				<h3>Reaching out to People</h3>

				<p>
					When reaching out to people, the most important step was figuring out where these groups of people hang out online, so as to use those means of communication for the most efficient results.
					Due to the pandemic, all interviews and questionnaires were conducted online.
				</p>

				<p>
					We got a head start on the interviews as one of the founders is part of an online Discord community with people that fitted the desired customer segment. This allowed us to have voice
					interviews with five people<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="text-reset">1</a></sup>, gathering information about topics like:
					<div class="container">		
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<div class="text-centered">
									<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
										<ul>
											<li>
												their most recent night out;
											</li>
											<li>
												their group dynamics;
											</li>
											<li>
												the ease of deciding where to go out;
											</li>
											<li>
												how they handled reservations;
											</li>
											<li>
												possible interactions with another group.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									
								</div>
							</div>
	
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
								<div>
									<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
										<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/interview.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>	
				</p>

				<p>
					Aside from the interviews, we put together a questionnaire in order to receive a larger number of answers to better understand
					the issue at hand.

					The questions were separated into categories that each focused on different aspects of going out and general profiling of the respondents.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from general information about the customers, the categories were designed so we could learn more about:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						their social habits;
					</li>
					<li>
						the usual group of people to go out with;
					</li>
					<li>
						what applications they used to communicate among each other;
					</li>
					<li>
						whether they would be open to interact with a different group.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Lastly, we left it as an option for people to give out their contact information in order to keep them posted about the progress of the project and to
				perhaps follow up with more questions or even an interview.
				</p>

				<p>
					The link was sent out on faculty WhatsApp groups, among groups of friends and other communities which featured the targeted segments.
					If you wish to complete the survey, the questionnaire is available online at: <a href="https://forms.gle/HmFFgqEDCFLd71Bo7">https://forms.gle/HmFFgqEDCFLd71Bo7</a>
				</p>

				<sup id="fn1">1. at the moment of the second milestone</sup>


				<h3>Keeping in Touch with the Respondents</h3>
				
				<p>
					The relationship with the people already interviewed is ongoing, them already being friends of one of the founders.
					As far as the survey is concerned, one of the questions lets the people responding give out their contact information.
				</p>
				<div class="container">		
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										We indicated the fact that we accept any kind of platform at this stage of the project (WhatsApp, Instagram, email) in order to more efficiently communicate with them.
										In turn, these people will receive updates about the state of the project at the end of each milestone.
									</p>
								</div>
								
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
							<div>
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
									<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/contact_form.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>	
				
				<p>
					This lets us solidify customer relationship while also giving us the opportunity to set up interviews with the survey respondents. Should the customers have concern
					about the way their contact information is used, we gave out one of the founder's faculty email in order for them to address any concern.
				</p>

				<h2>Adapting the Project Idea</h2>

				<p>
					The main information we received at this stage of the project came from the interviews, as adjacent responses to the addressed questions.
				</p>

				<div class="container">		
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										From the responses we received on our survey, we gathered that people in our target audience already have a group of friends formed. This
										means that we had to change our approach and focus on incentivizing users to refer their friends to join the app.
									</p>
								</div>
								
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
							<div>
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
									<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/formed_group.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>	

				<p>
					During the talks, we also found that the interviewees mostly were interested in ways to:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							decide more efficiently where to go out;
						</li>
						<li>
							communicate with other groups about opportunities to meet up;
						</li>
						<li>
						 	add people to their group for a specific activity.
						</li>
					</ul>

					Currently, the direction of the project is to come to the aid of groups who are already having online conversations about where
					to go out and want to move the party into the real world. We aim to provide tools for better synchronization among friends,
					cool new places or activities for groups to explore and ways for smaller groups to get together and have double the fun!
				</p>

				<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

				<p>
					The next steps for the project are mainly to continue with the customer discovery and to solidify a relationship with our potential
					customers. These being said, however, we will also start testing the newly formed project ideas with more targeted questions in the following interviews.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important step is to try and convert the survey answers into voice interviews. We will extend the question to the people who filled out their contact
					information, and who have already proved their interest in the project. We will explain to them the current status of the project, and overall keep a close
					relationship with our audience. This will ease our way into the next phase, which will be Customer Validation.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Currently, it is too soon to move to the Customer Validation stage, due to our low number of interviews and survey answers. We also still need to ask more precise
					questions given the new direction of the project.

					We will still use the initial survey to gather general answers, more specific questions being asked subsequently.
