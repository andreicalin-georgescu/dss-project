				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>
					People are always curious to try that new spot in town. Most often than not, they end up going there by themselves. Schedules are hard to synchronize.
					And even if by some miracle you could go out with your group of friends, it is not mandatory for everyone to enjoy that cool place you found online.
				</p>

				<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p>
					This is where <em>Clique</em> comes in! Clique is an app that matches its users based on common places of interest. Found that new hot spot in town?
					Choose the desired timeframe and you will be matched with people wanting to go there as well. Once two people like each other, they are automatically
					put in the same group. After you all had a good time, if you enjoyed a person in particular, add them to your clique and go out again!

				<h2>Customer Segment</h2>
				<p>
					Clique is designed with young adults in mind. Those who are already comfortable meeting new people online on social media platforms
					will find themselves right at home. People who might otherwise find it hard to connect on the spot can use the platform to make new,
					meaningful relationships.
				</p>
				<p>
					In more precise terms, this means generally a customer group of people from 19 to 35 years old, with access to an internet-connected
					smartphone, mainly located in an urban area.
				</p>

				<h2>Competition</h2>
				<ul>
					<h3><a href="https://www.meetup.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Meetup</a></h3>
					<p>
						Meetup is a a platform where people post public events, albeit in-person or online. Then users can join the event and
						add it to the calendar. It has various activity ranges, from outdoor gatherings to online workshops.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://okplusone.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">PlusOne Social</a></h3>
					<p>
						As the name suggests, it allows finding a "plus one" so as not go out alone. It is limited only to one-on-one 
						interactions and users have to post a public invite in order to find a partner.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.skout.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Skout</a></h3>
					<p>
						Skout is a subscription-based service that allows its users to make new friends but does not focus specifically
						on partnering up to go out.
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.meetme.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">MeetMe</a></h3>
					<p>
						MeetMe builds up a user profile and lets people connect through public posts. 
					</p>

					<h3><a href="https://bumble.com" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">Bumble BFFs</a></h3>
					<p>
						Through Bumble, people can choose to interact with other users they matched with in the last 24 hours. It can also be
						used to search for friendships instead of romantic interests.
					</p>
				</ul>

				<h2>What We Bring to the Table</h2>
				<p>
					Clique is focused on creating <em>groups of people</em>. It uses a matchmaking system based on mutual swipes to ensure that two
					people agree with each other. It also aims to build relationships that extend over a simple night out. Users can add people to their
					own personal <em>clique</em> to go out again. And one person can be part of multiple cliques! One for every place they fancy going out to.
				</p>

				<h2>Key Metrics</h2>
				<p>
					Our service measures its success based on the following quantifiable indicators:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Number of new users per month;
						</li>
						<li>
							Active monthly users;
						</li>
						<li>
							Number of successfully created groups;
						</li>
						<li>
							Number of monthly active cliques.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Cost Structure</h2>
				<p>
					There is a combination of both variable and fixed costs as far as the cost structure of Clique is concerned:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Variable costs:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Cloud Hosting Services;
								</li>
								<li>
									Google Maps API.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Fixed costs:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Marketing and Advertising;
								</li>
								<li>
									Website Custom Domain and Email Server;
								</li>
								<li>
									Licensing Fees.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
				<p>
					Clique can support multiple revenue streams. 
				</p>

				<p> 
					On one hand, it will serve relevant advertisements to its users in a non-intrusive way. Users can also opt for a monthly subscription fee
					to stop receiving sponsored content and to gain early access to new features <br>
					On the other hand, venues can pay for a place at the top of our local hotspots list.

				<p id="Milestone_2" title="Milestone 2"><em>Milestone 2</em></p>

				<h2>Identifying the Problem</h2>

				<p>
					The idea for the project came naturally from our group of friends. When planning a night out, the process usually involved lots of back-and-forth
					texting between us. Trying to find a time where most of us could make it proved to take us more time than actually figuring out where to go.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another issue was when our group of friends did not have enough people to accommodate a certain activity. The most recent event was when trying to
					plan out a paintball game and figuring out that five people would not make for much of a fun game. That is when we had to go out of our way to find four
					more people who enjoyed getting a fresh coat of paint along with some small bruises to document the fun times.
				</p>

				<h2>Initial Solution</h2>

				<p>
					We started looking at the problem from an individual's point of view: trying to connect with people based on similar interests and form a new group of friends.
					This would have allowed for flexibility, meaning you could have chosen one of your many, newly formed groups of friends for each one of your planned activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					A user would express the desire to go to a certain place and receive suggestions of people wanting to go there as well. Initially, if two people wanted to be part of the
					same group, a new party would be formed and new members would have needed to be accepted by the group as a whole.
				</p>

				<h2>Planning out Customer Discovery</h2>

				<p>
					We set off firstly drawing out the necessary attributes that our average user had to have: 
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							be familiar with technology;
						</li>
						<li>
							live in a place with enough social offers to make going out attractive;
						</li>
						<li>
							be open to meeting new people with similar interests as them.
						</li>
					</ul>

					Then we came up with an age group (18 - 30 years old) which we then divided into smaller groups based on current educational and employment status. This is how we ended up with three main groups:
					18 - 23, 24 - 27 and 28 - 30 years old.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next step was creating a rough persona for every segment, identifying main interests, life defining events (Bachelor's degree, getting the first job) and overall social status. This led us to a
					a more targeted approach in terms of how we carried out the validation process.
				</p>

				<h2>The Discovery Process</h2>

				<h3>Identifying the Segments</h3>
				<p >
					We decided from the start to only focus on people over 18, due to the fact that they have a more active social life and can also provide consent as far as meeting new people is concerned. Afterwards, a major
					differentiator between the segments was the last graduated form of education.
				</p>

							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										Another decision we made from the start was to focus on the urban environment because of all the opportunities it provides in terms
										of activities for people to enjoy. After roughly figuring out the segments, we began describing them in more detail, referring to their income and 
										whether or not they had a strongly linked group of friends.

				</div>

				<h3>Reaching out to People</h3>

				<p>
					When reaching out to people, the most important step was figuring out where these groups of people hang out online, so as to use those means of communication for the most efficient results.
					Due to the pandemic, all interviews and questionnaires were conducted online.
				</p>

				<p>
					We got a head start on the interviews as one of the founders is part of an online Discord community with people that fitted the desired customer segment. This allowed us to have voice
					interviews with five people<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1" class="text-reset">1</a></sup>, gathering information about topics like:
					<div class="container">		
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<div class="text-centered">
									<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
										<ul>
											<li>
												their most recent night out;
											</li>
											<li>
												their group dynamics;
											</li>
											<li>
												the ease of deciding where to go out;
											</li>
											<li>
												how they handled reservations;
											</li>
											<li>
												possible interactions with another group.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									
								</div>
							</div>
	
							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
								<div>
									<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
										<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/interview.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>	
				</p>

				<p>
					Aside from the interviews, we put together a questionnaire in order to receive a larger number of answers to better understand
					the issue at hand.

					The questions were separated into categories that each focused on different aspects of going out and general profiling of the respondents.
				</p>
				<p>
				Aside from general information about the customers, the categories were designed so we could learn more about:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						their social habits;
					</li>
					<li>
						the usual group of people to go out with;
					</li>
					<li>
						what applications they used to communicate among each other;
					</li>
					<li>
						whether they would be open to interact with a different group.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Lastly, we left it as an option for people to give out their contact information in order to keep them posted about the progress of the project and to
				perhaps follow up with more questions or even an interview.
				</p>

				<p>
					The link was sent out on faculty WhatsApp groups, among groups of friends and other communities which featured the targeted segments.
					If you wish to complete the survey, the questionnaire is available online at: <a href="https://forms.gle/HmFFgqEDCFLd71Bo7">https://forms.gle/HmFFgqEDCFLd71Bo7</a>
				</p>

				<sup id="fn1">1. at the moment of the second milestone</sup>


				<h3>Keeping in Touch with the Respondents</h3>
				
				<p>
					The relationship with the people already interviewed is ongoing, them already being friends of one of the founders.
					As far as the survey is concerned, one of the questions lets the people responding give out their contact information.
				</p>
				<div class="container">		
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										We indicated the fact that we accept any kind of platform at this stage of the project (WhatsApp, Instagram, email) in order to more efficiently communicate with them.
										In turn, these people will receive updates about the state of the project at the end of each milestone.
									</p>
								</div>
								
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
							<div>
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
									<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/contact_form.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>	
				
				<p>
					This lets us solidify customer relationship while also giving us the opportunity to set up interviews with the survey respondents. Should the customers have concern
					about the way their contact information is used, we gave out one of the founder's faculty email in order for them to address any concern.
				</p>

				<h2>Adapting the Project Idea</h2>

				<p>
					The main information we received at this stage of the project came from the interviews, as adjacent responses to the addressed questions.
				</p>

				<div class="container">		
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										From the responses we received on our survey, we gathered that people in our target audience already have a group of friends formed. This
										means that we had to change our approach and focus on incentivizing users to refer their friends to join the app.
									</p>
								</div>
								
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
							<div>
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
									<img src="images/Pictures-dss/Customer_segments/formed_group.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>	

				<p>
					During the talks, we also found that the interviewees mostly were interested in ways to:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							decide more efficiently where to go out;
						</li>
						<li>
							communicate with other groups about opportunities to meet up;
						</li>
						<li>
						 	add people to their group for a specific activity.
						</li>
					</ul>

					Currently, the direction of the project is to come to the aid of groups who are already having online conversations about where
					to go out and want to move the party into the real world. We aim to provide tools for better synchronization among friends,
					cool new places or activities for groups to explore and ways for smaller groups to get together and have double the fun!
				</p>

				<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

				<p>
					The next steps for the project are mainly to continue with the customer discovery and to solidify a relationship with our potential
					customers. These being said, however, we will also start testing the newly formed project ideas with more targeted questions in the following interviews.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another important step is to try and convert the survey answers into voice interviews. We will extend the question to the people who filled out their contact
					information, and who have already proved their interest in the project. We will explain to them the current status of the project, and overall keep a close
					relationship with our audience. This will ease our way into the next phase, which will be Customer Validation.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Currently, it is too soon to move to the Customer Validation stage, due to our low number of interviews and survey answers. We also still need to ask more precise
					questions given the new direction of the project.

					We will still use the initial survey to gather general answers, more specific questions being asked subsequently.

							For the wireframe:

							<p>
								The first step before creating the first iterations of the wireframes was to define the basic functionalities of our application. We reached to
								the conclusion that our application should do two things best: <em>User Sign-Up</em> and <em>Creating a Group</em>.
							</p>

							<div class="container">		
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
										<div class="text-centered">
											<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
												<p>
													For the <strong>User-Signup</strong> the important part was getting the user as fast as possible through all the steps necessary.
													This is why we agreed on using the phone number as a way of registering people. We iterated through multiple versions of the wireframe
													for this logical flow before ending up on a version.
												</p>
											</div>
											
										</div>
									</div>
			
									<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
										<div>
											<div class="mb-4 d-flex">

											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="container">		
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
										<div class="text-centered">
											<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
												<p>
													For <strong>starting a go-out</strong> the most important part we agreed on is the efficient selection of a place to go out. We then had
													to combine this with the ability to set up groups with close people for certain activities.
												</p>
											</div>
											
										</div>
									</div>

											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>
								This is why the app will suggest "starred" and "hot" places. Starred places are recommended to each individual based on past go-outs and personal selection. Hot
								places are considered by the number of active Clique users who are either at that location or are setting up groups to go to that location.
							</p>

							<p>
								Another idea we had was to offer each user suggestions of groups they could create based on common activities among their friends. This works by cross referencing
								every individual's interests and their friends. These suggestions will be available in the main screen, for quick access.
							</p>
							
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Refining the Brainstorms</h2>
				<p>
					We used Balsamiq in order to quickly ideate and iterate through our different ideas. This is how the ideas changed after several meetings.
					One way the user flow changed was the ability to have users add new friends through their contact list <em>and</em> be able to find friends that are already in the app.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another way we ended up changing the user experience was including a maps view of nearby groups going out. The user can now see at a glance a summary of people who are searching
					for others to complete their party. 
				</p>

				<div class="container">		
					<div class="col-md-12 row">
						<img id="wireframe" src="images/Pictures-dss/M3/USER-SIGNUP.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto">
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<p>
					In terms of actively searching for a place to go out, we ended up thinking of a system where an initiator could send out invites to several of their friends and then people could
					accept and talk about a time that suits the party. The party leader has the possibility to let other people invite friends to complete the group. Also, they can call to make a reservation.
					We are currently investigating an option where the initiator have the group automatically disband after the agreed date.
				</p>

					<div class="col-md-12 row">

					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<p>
					Since the previous stage of the project, we have kept in touch with several of the people surveyed. We set up an email list to connect with the people interested.
					This will help us for the next stage, because we plan to create several focus groups, representative for every customer segment. Several variants of wireframes will be put together
					in order to conduct A/B testing and collect feedback about the ease of use, and accessibility. Another point of interest will be the intuitiveness of using the application's features.
				</p>

				<p>
					Simultaneously we will push forward with having more people interested in the project, gathering contact information from the landing page. Moreover, we will set up follow up
					interviews in order to test the flow of the current wireframes and create different variants based on their answers. We are currently experimenting with the idea of having brainstorm
					sessions and iterate through several versions of wireframes.

				<h2>Potential Users Interviews</h2>
				<p>
					Before carrying out the user interviews, we started drawing up a framework to be sure that every one of the important aspects of our
					application has been covered. We defined the main components of our project and created relevant question from which we could understand
					our users behavior regarding each of those aspects. The question framework can be inspected at the following link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8pl6VoyZ3g8q7-Ia94DP4XC9zJvss-rML3au_2wXC4/edit?usp=sharing">framework</a>
				</p>

				<p>
					Afterwards, the interviews were conducted either via phone or on discord, and recorded. The recordings will be kept for internal reference. They are available at
					the following <a href="#">link</a> <del>You can access the link and submit a request to view them.</del> The link has been made completely private, but we can provide access to the
					recordings upon receiving a request to do so.
				</p>

				<p>
					The interviews did not always follow the framework put in place, which served like more of a starting point for discussion.
				</p>

				<h2>Use cases</h2>
				<p>
					From the user interviews, we refined our previous use cases we defined in Milestone 3. We received valuable information that revolved around the group dynamics of our users. This led us to consider changes regarding who makes the actual reservations,
					who initiates a party and what is the most efficient way of synchronizing people together for a go-out.
				</p>

				<p>
					We understood that our app could be used by mainly two types of people: those who like to initiate parties and those who receive invitations to a group. This means that we need to provide party starters with the right tools to gather their
					friends and party goers with enough incentives for them to initiate their own gatherings.
				</p>

				<h2>Updating the Wireframes</h2>
				<p>
					With some of the users we have also conducted A/B testing on some wireframes variants. This is how we ended up creating variants for sign up using email and password instead of phone number. Another change was creating an alternate screen that instead of
					using Maps to show nearby parties we could instead show a list of recommendations as front page. Lastly, we concluded that in order to incentivize people to join parties, we should show relevant details such as leader name, party purpose (e.g. party, getting drinks)
				</p>
				<p>
					Gathering details from our users, we also updated the <a href="https://cliquetheproject.netlify.app/" class="text-reset text-decoration-none">landing page</a>. Aside from this, we also identified new ways we could add revenue streams into the application, without damaging
					the overall user experience.

				<h2>Refactoring the Landing Page</h2>

				<p>
					Since our first version of the landing page we understood that we needed to make our purpose clear right from the start. This is why even before adding analytics we decided to rearrange the page so that email signup is one of the first things people arriving on the page will notice.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also decided that if we are asking people to sign up to our newsletter we should offer something more than just the idea of the project. This is why we spent a good portion of these two weeks designing a demo, showcasing the application's concept.
				</p>

				<h2>Building a Demo</h2>
				<p>
					The demo was built using Adobe UX. It showcases the process of user signup, adding friends and starting a party for going out. In terms of where we placed this demo on our page, we decided the best spot was right in the navbar, next to the "Clique" text. You can inspect the demo accessing our
					landing page on this <a href="https://cliquetheproject.netlify.app/" class="text-decoration-none">link</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					By use of this demo we managed to keep users engaged on our page and provide them with additional content in exchange for their contact information. This lets our visitors know that we are serious about releasing the product and are looking forward for their input.
				</p>

				<h2>Adding Analytics and Defining Goals</h2>
				<p>
					We used the Netlify framework for our forms so we could send automatic mails to our new users, as well as provide them with a feedback message that the newsletter sign up has been done successfully. Then we decided that we have two main goals: have users spend time on our landing page and sign up for
					our newsletter.
				</p>

							<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<p>
									Next we went on to add Google Analytics and Hotjar to our website. We added analytics using the code snippet which we inserted into the Netlify framework and Hotjar using Google Tag Manager.
								</p>

									When creating the thank you message, we included traceback links to our website, inviting people to try our demo if they have not done so, and share the link with their friends to begin creating their group of close
									friends. This way, we increase the traffic on our site with users who are already interested in our project and perhaps want to learn more.

				<h2>Bringing People to the Landing Page</h2>

								<p>
									The biggest consideration we took when thinking about how we should approach lead generation was where did our users hang out. This is why we firstly used the list of customers we acquired during the previous milestones. We approached
									our potential users and informed them on the progress of the project, suggesting that they should share the link further in order to grow their own network inside the application.
								</p>

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Next, we remembered that most of our user segment was spending time online on platforms such as Instagram and Discord. Judging by this, we created posts from the founders' accounts to announce the progress we made and invite people onto our landing page.
					Knowing the particularities of each social network, we decided to post on Instagram Stories (as they usually reach more people than regular posts) and dedicated Discord servers aimed at communities whose main interest is going out, finding new places or
					urban exploration.

						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					This generated enough traffic to be able to understand how users interacted with our page and where we should make changes. The most important win was that we had users come in who were already interested in the project. This allowed us to collect fairly relevant data right
					from the start. A detail of the findings will be covered in the next section.
				</p>

				<h2>Checking Goal Conversions and Adapting</h2>

				<h3>Getting the Initial Data</h3>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
						<div class="text-centered">
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<p>
									After getting the first few hits on the website, we could gather from the realtime data in Google Analytics, most of our users spent time just reading the page. This was good initially, but after a few hours we noticed that not a lot of people were entering their emails.
									Checking our data further, we noticed that most of our users came from our mobile version of the site. So we concluded something was wrong on our mobile version.
								</p>
							</div>
							
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Jumping into Hotjar we began looking through our mobile recordings. From there we gathered that many people were having trouble finding our demo. The problem was that the navbar was collapsed in the mobile version. Therefore we agreed upon adding another button for reaching the demo page right
					after the email field. Although the styling is not final, the functionality provided had to be shipped as fast as possible to capitalize on incoming users.
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Goal Conversions</h3>

				<p>
					Checking the pages visited, we saw that 16% of our incoming users reached the Thank You! screen, meaning that they finalized the sign up process. Other than this, people were curious
					to see who the members of the team are.
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					Another metric of interest was seeing how many of our users spent more than 5 minutes visiting our site. For this we set up a goal conversion and cross referenced it with our traffic sources.
					This showed us that although the source that generated the most traffic was Instagram, it also came with a high bounce rate. People who received the link directly, either from Discord or through
					an email, were more likely to be interested in the project and complete the conversion track.
				</p>

				<div class="container">		
					<div class="col-md-12 row">
						<img src="images/Pictures-dss/M5/conversion.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto">
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Next Steps</h2>

				<p>
					The following weeks will be aimed towards collecting data and implementing changes onto our website as we move on to help users interact with it better. The main goal will be to reduce the bounce rate, either by making the site be
					more attractive for mobile users, or searching new, more targeted areas to popularize our link.
				</p>

				<p>
					As a first improvement, we will look into adding more details about each of the members once someone clicks on one of the portraits. This will add proof about each of our skills and increase the likeliness that our users will have
					confidence into the success of the project.

				<h2>Defining our competition</h2>

				<p>
					Clique is a solution that essentially aggregates multiple functionalities of other applications people are already using. This is why, in order to determine our competition, we established the main parts of our application. Clique would have a
					recommendations system, a built-in communication method among friends and add social proof and value for places and activities in the city. With this in mind, we looked back at the results of our first survey.
				</p>

				<p>
					The main applications people already use are:

					<ul>
						<li>
							Google Maps - for searching new places;
						</li>
						<li>
							Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook - for communicating with friends and organizing a night out.
						</li>
					</ul>

							<div class="text-centered">
								<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
									<p>
										Another major player in terms of similarity with what our application provides is Meetup. However, there are still significant differences between out approaches. Meetup serves as a platform for events, online or offline, to which people can sign up
										for. However, their presence in the Bucharest market is slim, with only a few events taking place in the area and most of them online.

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					
				</p>

				<h2>Gathering Data</h2>

				<p>In order to gather the required data, we first turned to our customer discovery segments. Our area of interest being Bucharest, at least for the first years on the market, we searched for relevant demographics data from the National Institute
					of Statistics.
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
						<div class="text-centered">
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<p>
									This is how we found data as recent as July 2021 regarding the total number of residents in Bucharest. We had to adjust our expectations to the data found. The total number of people aged 20-34 is around 2 million. This was encouraging at first,
									but we went on further to corroborate our data with that of our competition.
								</p>
							</div>
							
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
								<img src="images/Pictures-dss/M6/demographic_bucharest.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					We turned to the Facebook Ads platform and simulated creating an advertisement in order to view the estimated impact. Choosing the Bucharest area, we discovered that there are more people our ads would be going towards than initially estimated using the data from the INSSE. 
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
						<div class="text-centered">
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
								<p>
									We hypothesized that this was due to the fact that many people currently live in Bucharest but do not necessarily have IDs with their place of residence in the city. Seeing how our application would target mostly young people (and especially students)
									we focused primarily on the data extracted from Facebook in order to determine our market. 
								</p>
							</div>
							
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">

							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					In order to further filter our target audience, we created sub-categories based on interest, therefore creating two categories: total number of people we could reach and the number of potential customers that are socially active. Since Clique relies heavily on social interactions in order to provide value, we defined
					our <strong>core market</strong> to people who regularly are interested in concerts, restaurants and other type of similar activities.
				</p>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">

								<img src="images/Pictures-dss/M6/core_audience.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					We then pursued finding data about the number of Instagram users. For this we only found articles about the total number of Instagram users in Romania in September 2021. In order to restructure our data for the Bucharest area, we calculated the percentage of people living in Bucharest from the country's
					total population. This percentage was roughly 11%. With this data in mind we obtained the following table.
				</p>

				<div class="container">		
					<div class="col-md-12 row">
						<img src="images/Pictures-dss/M6/instagram_table.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto">
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					We calculated the minimum amount of users. Judging by the findings from the Facebook ads platform, it is fair to expect that simply calculating a percentage from the population currently residing in Bucharest would not give us the total number of potential users. This calculation only provided us with a minimum
					number we could expect.
				</p>

				<p>
					As far as the number of WhatsApp users is concerned, we could not find any relevant data, the latest news dating all the way back to 2015. We also encountered difficulties in finding data about usage habits of people using Google Maps.
				</p>

				<h2>Defining the Target Market</h2>

				<p>
					Basing our market on the Facebook research we concluded that we could expect a number between 898.000 - 1.1mil users aged 18-34 as the primary target audience. A more significant number for us, though, is the size of our <strong>core audience</strong> - socially active people with already a curated taste for going out. Using
					the found data, we concluded that these people amounted to roughly 650.000 - 770.000 people.
				</p>

				<p>
					In order to estimate the number of users we could count on that already use Instagram, we used the minimum determined in the previous table.
				</p>

				<h2>Potential Market Share</h2>

				<p>
					For the market share, we count on a rapid growth in order to sustainably have user retention. The application comes alive when more people begin adding friends and interacting with each other. Planning to launch the application among students, a successful launch will mean a close knit group of people with similar interest. This will represent
					the first few loyal users, that can become promoters if they are satisfied with our service.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the first year, we count on obtaining 1.000 recurring users. We believe this is an obtainable number. Due to the fact that an average group of friends has 3 members, that means we need to reach around 300 people in the first year and provide enough value for them to keep using the application.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the second year, we plan on reaching 10.000 users. This will be the biggest challenge for our application, because the growth needs to be 10x the one from the year before. Besides simply providing value, we will need to keep tailoring our application in order to cater to our potential market's needs. This will mean interacting with focus groups selected from
					current and possible users in order to change the overall user experience.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the third and fourth year, we plan on reaching 50.000 and 70.000 users. This means potentially adding new functionalities to the application or interacting with local business in order to provide additional value to our users.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the fifth year, our targeted market share is 20% from the <strong>core market</strong> determined earlier. This translates to 150.000 users that return to our app and use its functionalities on a regular basis. With this kind of audience Clique could begin being a serious competitor on the market of social applications, at least for the Bucharest area.
				</p>

				<h2>Potential Market Value</h2>

				<p>
					As far as the market value is concerned, for our particular application this will be calculated assigning each user a revenue quota. As the main objective of our first years will be user acquisition, we believe that this will be the best indication of how much revenue we could count on.
				</p>

				<p>
					The growth in individual user monetary value will closely follow the expected exponential growth in new users. The user value will be roughly as follows:
					<ul>
						<li>
							1st year - 1$
						</li>
						<li>
							2nd year - 3$
						</li>
						<li>
							3rd year - 10$
						</li>
						<li>
							4th year - 13$
						</li>
						<li>
							5th year - 20$
						</li>
					</ul>

					Our increase in value comes both from increasing the size of potential audience for advertising, and from the fact that our audience will be curated and clustered in groups of interest.
				</p>

				<p>
					This means that by our 5th year we could count on 150.000 users with a 20$ value for each user. Naturally these numbers are only an estimate and in order for ensuring our success we will have to be permanently monitoring the market and competition.
				</p>

				<p>
					Using data from the Media Fact Book, the 2020 and the 2021 edition, we then began to estimate the value of the digital ad market in Romania. Our findings show that the digital ad market is still secondary to TV advertising. If we look for data in the U.S. we can see however that the digital ad market share is around 20% higher.
					This means that in the following years we can expect a growth in market share for digital ads.

									Going further, we researched the total amount spent on advertising by medium in 2020. We can notice a decline in revenue due to the Covid pandemic. To quote from the Media Fact Book, 2021: <em>"Digital spend grew up by 6% vs. 2019, reaching 105M euro, significantly influenced by programmatic (+20%), Google (+8%) and Facebook (+6%), while local display decreased by 5%.</em>
								</p>
							</div>
							
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">
						<div>
							<div class="mb-4 d-flex">
								<img src="images/Pictures-dss/M6/digital_spend.png" class="img-fluid.max-width: 100%" >
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				
				<p>
					<em>
						"From a media consumption perspective, 2020 brought a significant leap in terms of internet penetration, reaching 90% in urban areas (vs. 86% in 2019), respectively 77% in rural areas (vs. 72% in 2019), with some segments attaining almost maximum numbers (e.g. households led by an employee, where children are also present, have 99% internet penetration).
						Mobile continued to be main device for almost all generations (less Baby Boomers who still have a preference for desktops or laptops), while the most usual activities (on mobile) were using messaging apps (85%), taking pictures (78%), accessing social media (76%), sending text messages (72%) and online video & online audio (65%)."
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					These findings show that increasingly more people are turning to mobile for their social needs, presenting us with the perfect environment for audience curation and advertising. Tailoring and serving personalized advertisements based on personal social habits will be an innovative field of advertising that Clique can use as a major revenue stream.
				</p>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">

									In terms of digital advertisements spending, there has been a steady increase in amount spent by media outlets, as shown in the following graph.
								</p>
							</div>
							
						</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 d-flex">

							<p>
								If we are to correlate this with the findings that increasingly more people, especially those in our targeted age group, are going online on the Internet, we identified that the digital advertising industry is still a very profitable sector in Romania. This is why we concluded that a platform who can aggregate users into interest groups can be prime material for the advertising industry.

				</div>

				<p>
					A final encouraging quote from the Media Facts Book, 2021 edition states that the digital ad sector is very attractive for Small Media Entities as well.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>
						"Generally, the digital ad sector is very attractive for SMEs. According to IAB statements, these smaller players represent 72% of total digital spending in Romania, and 74% of total spending on social and search ads. Our reports have focused, historically, on major advertisers, whose digital spending we estimated at around 100M Euro, for the last year. We believe that adding the “long tail” of
						SMEs, mostly active on Google and Facebook platforms, would take the total to around 300M Euro."
					</em>
				</p>

				<h2>Market Conclusions</h2>

				<p>
					Where Clique can benefit is the exponential nature of its growth. If we manage to satisfy a small group of users, their friends will want to create separate groups for different activities. This means that our expected growth rate could be obtained by providing sustainable value to our customers.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the first three to four years our main reason will be to keep the application alive with relevant revenue streams. Our main goal during these initial years will be user acquisition and retention. Without a constant number of core users, the application will not function long enough to reach the estimated market share.
				</p>

				<p>
					After these few first years, a major revenue stream for Clique will be advertising. Clique will be especially relevant to advertisers because our audience will already be clustered in small groups, increasing the chance for word of mouth marketing. Furthermore, our core users will already have a habit of going out, socializing and making new connections. This means
					that their spending habits could be a major benefit our application will have over the competition. Since their habits will revolve around being socially active, promoting advertisements curated to their particular momentary interest will increase the efficiency of any digital ad campaign.

				<h2>Revising our Findings</h2>
				<p>
					Based on our research through questionnaires we profiled several personas of possible users for our Clique App based on age and evolution of interests at different stages in life. But there is one trait that can be seen as dominant throughout. Some people like to initiate happenings, and we will refer to them as ‘party starters’ , others act more as valuators.
				</p>
				<p>
					Roles may change in time and Clique App aims in its evolution to make it so fun that anyone becomes a party starter of some sort. However, for the MVP it became clear from our research that we should initially focus on the party starters – those people who usually suggest to their friends or acquaintances to go somewhere or do something. 
				</p>
				<p>
					They are also pivotal in bringing people to Clique since their influence is exponential once they find our app as useful for initiating meetings/events.
				</p>

				<h2>Focusing on the Party Starters</h2>
				
				<p>From our in-depth interviews it resulted that most of the times the party starters know what they want to do, they only need to easily build an invite and motivate the others to join in.</p>
				<p>In our Clique Application we will focus to make it easy and fun for party starters to gather people around a going out idea! </p>
				<p>The steps for a party starter to gather friends around an idea are:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Find a place from Google Maps where to invite people;
					</li>
					<li>
						Record a video invite to stir your friends’ interest (limited to 15s) – with yourself, or your voice as narrator;
						<ul>
							<li>
								In later versions  we will focus to directly add metadata on the video: factual  (date and hour, place, other requirements) + creative (creative options to individualize the video invite).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Send the video invite to a list of people – inside the app or via WhatsApp, Messages etc.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Invitees can see the video following a link regardless if they are on Clique or not. <strong>However, to react to the invite</strong> they need to download and register in Clique App. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Possible reactions to the invite: coming, maybe, decline. In later stages: possibility to edit the video invite creatively to mark your response or to further share it.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Automatically open a group chat (similar to other social networks' layout) where all the people that validated the invite (‘coming’) are included and can ask for details or keep track of the outcome;
						<ul>
							<li>
								‘Maybe’ sets a reminder in that person’s Clique calendar. (In later stages it may be linked with Google calendar or other calendars of user’s choice);
							</li>
							<li>
								Chat groups are automatically dissolved 1 day after the event happens. There will be an opt out button if you want to make the group permanent;
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In terms of building intelligence for a post MVP stage of the app:
						</p>
						<p>
							Right after signing up in the app, people can opt to specify their main interests from a list and also their favourite places to go out by pinning them on Google Maps  … or not.  This will allow us to build a recommended area through which we can communicate events open to the general public.  
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Notes on the validity of each of the  steps:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						A place that people like or are interested in discovering appeared from our findings to be the best liason for any going out activity.
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The video recording of their own message for an invite resulted from our talks with party starters as the easiest to implement and the most personal one. It needs further research and validation in terms of length of video and features to add on.
						</p>

						<p>
							For later versions we want to focus on making this item as a main creative hook for the app. For e: you can edit any video invite you received inside Clique, record your own reaction to the initial invite and share the new version further to your Clique.
							It is a natural consequence of the initial idea: the success of the invite is based on the traction of the initiator to the members of his group.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						We looked for a powerful way to motivate downloading and registering inside the app for people that are not party starters. This is why we came up with offering recommendations right from the start, so the single user can still enjoy Clique as their "City discovery tool".
					</li>
					<li>
						Ease of communication appeared as one of the biggest hurdles for party starters. They use individual WhatsApp messages, call each individual etc. Automating the process and keeping track of the discussion is paramount. 
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Current Status of the MVP</h3>
				<p>
					We focused on building the MVP on the iOS platform. We will later migrate the application for Android users, but the limited number of devices we need to test the application on was the main differentiatior.
				</p>
				<p>
					By far, the biggest challenge with the application is building the realtime chat. This has been the main focus of the MVP building process and everything indicates great progress in this regard. The frontend and logic have been put together using Swift and the backend is powered by
					Google's Firebase.
				</p>
				<p>
				So far the MVP supports:

				<p>
					For the upcoming weeks, the next steps regarding the MVP are :
					<ul>
						<li>
							Adding the interest selection logic;
						</li>
						<li>
							Adding the place recommendation logic, along with a notification mechanism for people invited;
						</li>
						<li>
							Improving the capabilities of the application allowing users to share photos, videos and locations in their chat conversations.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Getting Eyes on The Application</h2>

				<p>At this stage, the application is built using the latests iOS SDKs and can therefore be tested only by a limited number of people. In order to popularize our alpha version of the applications, we plan to leverage our already growing database of interested people.</p>

				<p>First of all, we will select focus groups by sending an email to our contacts, offering them exclusive access to the very first versions of the app. This will provide them with a feel for the application and its intended use, and will offer us important analytics and data in order
					to make improvements to the application.
				</p>

				<p>There will also be a general call to action placed on our landing page, notifying visitors that our application has an MVP and they can sign up to be selected to test it. This will both drive up our landing page conversion, as well as provide us with new testing leads for our application.</p>

				<p>In order to actually test the application, users will install the <em>TestFlight</em> application from the iOS AppStore and will report bugs and findings using the proper channels provided by Apple.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will continuously assess the number of people who sign up for the first version of the application and once a satisfactory number of users has been achieved we will consider that our "first sale" took place.
